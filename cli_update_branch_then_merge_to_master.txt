git clone https://github.com/obrienke/first-repository.git #only need to run this once and all files copied down to folder you run this command from. Beauty of it, is that is you come back to this folder another day, and open a git bash session, then just type git pull, of course make sure you have the right branch checked out.
cd first-repository/
git checkout first-branch
# create a file
git add .
git commit -m "TEST NEW FILE ADDED TO BRANCH"
git push origin first-branch # may get prompted for a login at this point


git checkout master
git pull # this command can be run at anytime to pull from repository on github onto the desktop to ensure your directory on your pc has the latest working version               
git merge first-branch #merges the changes from first branch to master.      
git push origin master 


# if you want to change the name of the user from git bash from obrienke to obrienke1:
git config user.name "obrienke1"
git config user.email "k_obrien342003@yahoo.ie"


Now try and push a change and see if on the repository in your browser it is flagged as change made by obrienke1, instead of obrienke.
